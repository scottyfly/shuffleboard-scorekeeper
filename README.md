Scorekeeper for Deck Shuffleboard Game
I've been learning web development and this is one of first projects I've worked on. I created it to help keep score for deck shuffleboard. I tried to make it as user friendly as possible.  I'm planning to re-create it with React.js as a way to practice what I've learned so far.
